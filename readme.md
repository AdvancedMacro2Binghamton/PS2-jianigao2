Problem Set 2

JIani Gao

1. There are 3 parts in my solution of homework 2.  

Part 1: I write down my solutions in a pdf file named "hw_2_jiani".
Part 2: All the codes for question 2, 3, 4 and 5 are put in the file named "codes".
Part 3: All the figures are put in the file named "figures", though these figures can also be viewed from the  pdf file above.


2. I think question 2 and 3 are relatively easy, since we can use the logic from what we have learned before. And the difference is that we need to write down two functions here to represent the two stochastic states.

3. I am not sure about my codes for question 4. First I assume the initial state is high productivity, so the initial probability is [1 0]. Then I use the transition matrix to calculate the probability for different states in each period, and then simulate a sample for technology shocks of size 1000. My confusion here is about the calculation of output :  I can use the sequence generated above as Ah and Al in different periods, but I don't know which 'k' I should use in different periods in order to get output. 

4. The other details are included in the pdf file "hw_2_jiani".
